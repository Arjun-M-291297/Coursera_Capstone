    "             New York City (NYC), often called The City or simply New York (NY), is the most populous city in the United States. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports.\n",
    "             As New York provides a vast field of oppurtunities there would be a huge amount of immigrants to NYC. Consider a scenario where a person with some sort health issue forced to move to New York City from some other part of U.S maybe because of work or studies. He would be confused to choose between which neighborhood he should choose to stay which will be nearest to Medical centres and Pharmacy, or in case of people who are health conscious and intereseted in Yoga.\n",
    "             This can be a relevant challenge to anyone who is planning to moving to NYC from other regions. The challenge is to find a suitable neighborhood in NYC that complies with the demands on access to Medical centres, Pharmacy and Yoga Studio."
